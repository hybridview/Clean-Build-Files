# Clean-Build-Files
Highly customizable Powershell script designed for cleaning build files from the local file system.
NOTE: If some files/folders were created with elevated prompt, then this script will not be able to delete them. You should run powershell as adminstrator and use the cd command to navigate the prompt to your directory. Then you can run this script.
